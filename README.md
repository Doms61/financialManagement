# financialManagement

This app servers as a management tool for finances. It should help, to keep in check all the expenses and incomes. With an easy overview of all the expenses one can see its spending habits.

I was inspired to do create this app, because I was using a custom made excel sheet, since I didn't liked any of the available tools/apps out there, or I just didn't wanted to pay for them. 
Although as of now (while I just created a hello world project and a new repo) the end project expectations are pretty low, just an app which I can use daily to track where my money is going, 
the future of the project on the other hand, can hold anything.

So if someone stumbled upon this project, at a later stage (e.g it's already usable) then feel free to message me, with your ideas of what can be improved or what would you like to see in it, so you could also use it. 

I will be updating this README (hopefully) regularly with new features, and milestones.

There's also a Jira for this project: https://financialmanagement-doms.atlassian.net/

Well, I kinda decided to keep a weekly status here. Most likely after the week.. meaning on fridays.

Status after the 1st week: 
 - Login and sign up are working, 
 - the user is stored in the firestore (firebase's DB), 
 - a simple user profile was also added, but that needs some improvements.

TODO for the next week: 
 - Finish user profile
 - Add Balance (wallet) creation
 - Add Budget creation

Status after the 2nd week: 
(I suppose, I should call them sprints xD ) 
 - User profile is on hold, started to be used as a testing view
 - Balance (wallet) creation is done. 
 - Started on working on spendings.
 
TODO for next sprint: 
 - finish single balance view
 - finish spendings (single spending view as well)
 - start with budget

Status after the 3rd sprint:
 - balance is done for now (there will be some changes in the future)
 - spendings close to be done

TODO: for the next sprint:
 - finish spending
 - start/finish budgets
 - create an outline (or a layout) for general overview
