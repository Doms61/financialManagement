# financialManagement

This app servers as a management tool for finances. It should help, to keep in check all the expenses and incomes. With an easy overwiev of all the expenses one can see its spenidng habbits.

I was inspired to do create this app, because I was using a custom made excel sheet, since I didn't liked any of the available tools/apps out there, or I just didn't wanted to pay for them. 
Allthought as of now (while I just created a hellow world project and a new repo) the end project expectations are pretty low, just an app which I can use daily to track where my money is going, 
the future of the project on the other hand, can hold anything.

So if someone stumbled upon this project, at a later stage (e.g it's already usable) then feel free to message me, with your ideas of what can be improved or what would you like to see in it, so you could also use it. 

I will be updating this README (hopefully) regurarly with new features, and milestones. 

There's also a Jira for this project: https://financialmanagement-doms.atlassian.net/
